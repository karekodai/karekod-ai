# Karekod AI

This repository contains the configuration and assets for the Karekod AI website, built using the Karekod Builder system.

## Structure

- `configuration.json` - Main website configuration defining page blocks and their properties
- `assets/` - Images and other static assets for the website
- `build/` - Final static website output (generated by the build process)

## Building the Website

To build the website, run the following command from the main karekod-builder directory:

```bash
npm run build karekod-ai
```

This will generate the static website files in the `build/` directory with complete HTTPS asset URLs for Cloudflare Pages deployment.
